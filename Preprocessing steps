df.head()
#returns the first few rows of the DataFrame, by default 5 rows.
#This is useful for getting a quick glance at the data, checking the column names, and verifying that the data has been loaded correctly.
df.tail()
#returns the last few rows of the DataFrame, by default 5 rows. 
#This is useful for checking the end of the data, especially when working with large datasets.
df.shape
#returns a tuple representing the dimensionality of the DataFrame, i.e., the number of rows and columns. 
#This is useful for understanding the size of the data.
df.info()
#provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the index dtype and column dtypes, non-nullable counts, and memory usage.
#This is useful for understanding the data types and structure of the DataFrame.
#check for missing values in column
df.isnull()
# Count the number of missing values in each column
df.isnull().sum()
df.dtypes
#returns the data types of each column in the DataFrame. 
#This is useful for understanding the data types of each column, which is essential for data analysis, cleaning, and processing.
